# projewski-jdungeon

This is a simple library for dungeon manipulation written in Java language.
I have written it to use in my own projects and after testing few common similar libraries.
My goal of create such library is write a better tested code and more unified.

**Features**
1. Dungeon generation algorithms
- my own implementation of the simple room generator

2. Path finder algorithms
- my own implementation of the shortes line path finder
